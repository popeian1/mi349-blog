            I woke up this morning at about 7:30 AM before I realized I set my alarm a
            bit to early. After sleeping for another hour I got up and showered. I then
            picked out what I wanted to wear and backed my bag, leaving for my 30 minute
            walk to the CommArtSci building for MI 420, Interacting Prototyping. We were
            discussing some design principles to help us with our 3D printing project,
            but I was focused on some personal business on my laptop regarding getting 
            some people moved into my co-op next fall. After I got out of that class, I
            walked in the heavily pouring rain to my next class in the Business Complex,
            MI 349, Web Design and Development at 12:40 PM. Right now I am currently 
            working on learning how to properly format HTML to current web standards. 
            When I get home my housemate is taking me to the store to get stuff to fix 
            both my bike and my car since they are both broken down, as well as stuff to 
            make dinner for my house. After that, I'll work on some homework, probably 
            play games for a bit, mentally prepare for work tomorrow and go to bed.
